# BeginerJava

INTRODUCTION:

Java repository that contains beginner examples, to-do projects, and documentation that is related to the YouTube series "Introduction to Programming in Java" by "Hello_World!"

Before beginning be sure to read the user guide as that will detail the coding standards used in this series, as well as some trouble shooting tips you can use if you get stuck. 

This repository will be updated with new content as it comes out, and that will be reflected in the table of contents. 

HOW YOU CAN CONTRIBUTE

If you see something that is inaccurate within the repository, feel free to create a pull request so that I can take a look into it; and potentially merge your solution with the main branch. 

As always thank you for your support, and I hope that this repository can help you in learning not only Java but elementary programming and computer science concepts.
